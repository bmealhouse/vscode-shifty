## Prerequisites

shifty depends on [codeface](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/codeface) typefaces. The easiest way to get started is to use our install script, however, you can also download the `.zip` or `.tar.xz` directly from [codeface](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/codeface) and install the fonts on your system manually.

> After installing fonts, **restart VS Code** for them to take affect

```sh
git clone git://github.com/bmealhouse/vscode-shifty-font-families.git
cd vscode-shifty-font-families && ./install.sh
```

### Windows

```sh
git clone git://github.com/bmealhouse/vscode-shifty-font-families.git
cd vscode-shifty-font-families
./install.ps1
